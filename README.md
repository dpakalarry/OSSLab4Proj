# Project: 
Open Source 3D printed Toaster

# Business Model: 
We at Dpakalarry Baking Co. intend to provide the general public with an Open Source Toaster for the modern day, allowing our users to create, edit, and distribute their own variations of their personal toaster, completely free of charge. Our busines instead will choose to focus on our artisinal products, largely to be used with our Open Source Toaster, from anything as simple as loaves of bread, easy-to-make meals like grilled cheese, just a toast away from perfection, to premuim products like gourmet sandwiches. Downloads and derivations of our Open Source Toaster will work as advertisements of our products, as derivators are required to give credit, spreading our name and getting out the message of our delicious food products, boosting our baking business to new heights.
